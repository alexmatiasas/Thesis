  abstract = {We study in QCD the physics of deeply virtual Compton scattering ͑DVCS͒-the virtual Compton process in the large s and small t kinematic region. We show that DVCS can probe a new type of off-forward parton distributions. We derive an Altarelli-Parisi-type of evolution equations for these distributions. We also derive their sum rules in terms of nucleon form factors of the twist-two quark and gluon operators. In particular, we find that the second sum rule is related to fractions of the nucleon spin carried separately by quarks and gluons. We estimate the cross section for DVCS and compare it with the accompanying Bethe-Heitler process at CEBAF and HERMES kinematics. ͓S0556-2821͑97͒00811-4͔},

  abstract      = {The distributions of pressure and shear forces inside the proton are investigated using lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD) calculations of the energy momentum tensor, allowing the first model-independent determination of these fundamental aspects of proton structure. This is achieved by combining recent LQCD results for the gluon contributions to the energy momentum tensor with earlier calculations of the quark contributions. The utility of LQCD calculations in exploring, and supplementing, the assumptions in a recent extraction of the pressure distribution in the proton from deeply virtual Compton scattering experiments is also discussed. Based on this study, the target kinematics for experiments aiming to determine the pressure and shear distributions with greater precision at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and a future Electron Ion Collider are investigated.},
